# cocktailfinder
This project is a web development project that focuses on the use of an external API, TheCocktailDB. https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php. Javascript is used to add Event Listeners to the buttons on the site that will trigger fetch requests to the API using different keys. The Pick One For Me button uses a random key provided on TheCocktailDB which chooses a drink at random. New objects are then created in the DOM and attached to their parent nodes. The objects are then populated with data which is derived directly from the promise object returned from the fetch request. The new objects are displayed on the screen. There are also radio button objects which will display specific drinks on the page.
